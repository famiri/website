Right now, AI is everywhere, copilots, smart assistants, agents.

But in most organizations, the real question isn’t: What can AI do?
 It’s: Who makes sure people can actually use it?

A recent PwC report said over 73% of executives plan to adopt GenAI,
 but only 14% of workers feel confident using it!

The gap is growing. Not because the tech isn’t smart.
But because we’re not designing for usability.

In my work across digital transformation projects, I’ve seen it repeatedly:
Tools are rolled out.
Trainings are held.
And then… silence.

Why? Because most teams don’t have someone to translate the promise of new tech into the problems people actually face everyday!

So let's consider that:

✅ Every transformation team needs a “Translation Lead.”
 Not a data scientist. Not a project manager. But someone who can ask:
 “How does this tool help your real day today?”

Let’s stop expecting users to catch up and meet them where they are!

Here are some action items that worked really well in our recent projects:

✔️ Appointing internal change champions , people who understand both the change and the business context.
 ✔️ Redefining adoption metrics , shift the focus from usage (logins) to actual business value and outcomes.
 ✔️ Building real feedback loops, involve your change team continuously, not just through one-time FAQs.

This is what real AI leadership looks like: Less implementation. More interpretation. What do you think?
